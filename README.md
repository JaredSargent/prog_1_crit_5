1. Create two ArrayLists: one for storing days of the week and another for temperatures.
2. Loop to gather input for each day of the week:
   a. Prompt the user to enter the day of the week.
   b. Prompt the user to enter the average temperature for the day.
   c. Add the day and temperature to their respective ArrayLists.
3. After all inputs, display the menu:
   a. If the user inputs "week", calculate and display:
      - The temperature for each day of the week.
      - The weekly average temperature.
4. Implement decision constructs and looping as needed to handle input and output.
5. Ensure the program gracefully handles unexpected inputs.
